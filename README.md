# Pentagram: Instagram, but with AI Images
🎨 Pentagram: Realtime Image Diffusion

Pentagram is an Instagram-like platform where users generate images using text prompts instead of uploading photos. The system leverages Stable Diffusion running on serverless GPUs, optimizing performance and scalability dynamically.

🔥 Features

🎨 Text-to-Image Generation – Users can generate high-quality images using Stable Diffusion and AI-powered prompts.

⚡ Serverless GPU Scaling – Dynamically allocates cloud GPUs, reducing costs while maintaining optimal performance.

🔍 Semantic Image Search – Enables searching for images based on semantic content rather than just keywords.

✅ Content Moderation – AI-based filtering to remove inappropriate or harmful content.

🎯 Personalized Recommendation System – Suggests images based on user preferences and interactions.

🌐 Responsive Web UI – Built with Next.js/React, ensuring a seamless and modern user experience.
🛠️ How It Works

User enters a text prompt – The system processes it through Stable Diffusion.

Image is generated dynamically – Using cloud-based GPUs for fast rendering.

Image is stored & indexed – For semantic search and recommendations.

Users can interact – Liking, sharing, and discovering AI-generated images.
